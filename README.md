# Wordle Clone: 

This web application recreates New York Time's "Wordle". The web app displays "congrats", "you lost", and user-error handling messages. 

Rules to the game: 

(1) The user has six chances to guess a five letter word (randomly chosen from sgb-words.txt). 
(2) If the user guesses a letter correctly (correct letter in the correct space), the letter turns GREEN
(3) If the user guesses a letter that is present in the word, but not in the same space, the letter turns YELLOW 
(4) If the user guesses a letter that is not present in the word, the letter turns GRAY: 

The word is "tumor", so "T" turns green and "O" turns yellow. The other letters turn gray.
